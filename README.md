# ETH price fetch using chainlink oracle

The online datafeed address that we used to interact and get the #ETH price in #USD was for "sepolia" test net. So you need to deploy it on sepolia test net.

```shell
Deploy the smart contract on sepolia test
Call the "getChainlinkDataFeedLatestAnswer" function
```
